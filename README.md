# Kooner Fleet Work Request Form

A branded HTML form for customers to submit fleet maintenance requests to Kooner Fleet Services.

## 📦 How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Clone or upload these files to your GitHub repository.
2. Go to Settings > Pages.
3. Under "Source", select "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder.
4. GitHub will publish your form at: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

## 🛠️ Customize

- To connect a custom domain (e.g., requests.koonerfleet.com), create a `CNAME` file with the domain name.
- Update `mailto:` in the form if email changes.

## ⚠️ Notes

The form uses `mailto:` which depends on user’s email client. For production, consider using Formspree or a backend handler.
